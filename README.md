# MY_LLM

This repository contains a simple implementation of a Language Model (LLM) in a Jupyter Notebook (`LLM.ipynb`). The notebook demonstrates the basic principles of building an LLM from scratch, focusing on tokenization, n-gram modeling, and text generation.
This repository provides a foundational implementation of a Language Model (LLM) within a Jupyter Notebook. It serves as an educational tool, demonstrating the core mechanics of building an LLM from scratch. By walking through data preprocessing, tokenization, n-gram modeling, and text generation, it offers a practical introduction to the statistical methods underlying language models. Ideal for those seeking to understand the basic principles of LLMs, this project allows for experimentation and customization, fostering a deeper understanding of how these models learn and generate text.

## Overview

The `LLM.ipynb` notebook walks through the following steps:

1.  **Data Loading and Preprocessing:**
    * Loads a text dataset.
    * Performs basic text cleaning.
2.  **Tokenization:**
    * Converts the text into a sequence of tokens (words or characters).
3.  **N-gram Modeling:**
    * Builds an n-gram model to capture the statistical relationships between tokens.
    * Calculates probabilities of token sequences.
4.  **Text Generation:**
    * Uses the n-gram model to generate new text.
    * Demonstrates how to sample tokens based on their probabilities.

## Getting Started

To run the notebook, you will need the following:

* **Python 3.x:** Ensure you have Python 3 installed.
* **Jupyter Notebook:** Install Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
* **Required Libraries:** Install the necessary Python libraries using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install numpy
    ```

### Running the Notebook

1.  Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/LIKITH43/MY_LLM.git](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/LIKITH43/MY_LLM.git)
    cd MY_LLM
    ```

2.  Start Jupyter Notebook:

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

3.  Open the `LLM.ipynb` notebook and execute the cells.

## Usage

The notebook is designed for educational purposes, providing a hands-on introduction to LLM concepts. You can modify the code to:

* Experiment with different datasets.
* Adjust the n-gram order.
* Implement different tokenization strategies.
* Improve the text cleaning steps.

## Example

The notebook contains examples of how to generate text using the trained n-gram model. You can observe the generated text and experiment with different parameters to see how they affect the output.
